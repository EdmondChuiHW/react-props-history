Enhances a React component and allows callbacks to be dispatched

## Install
`npm i react-dispatchable -D`

## Example
Consider this `PizzaBuilder`:
```
import React, {useState} from 'react';
import Dropdown from "‚Ä¶";

const PizzaBuilder = props => {
  const [status, setStatus] = useState('Hungry');
  const setCrustType = crust => setStatus(`Selected üçï crust: ${crust}`);

  return <>
    <div>{status}</div>
    <Dropdown
      onItemSelected={setCrustType}
    />
  </>;
};
```
To test that the correct crust is shown after an item from `Dropdown` has been selected, you might be tempted to mock away `Dropdown`, or use some selectors to drill down the DOM tree, find the dropdown, simulate a click event, find the row with the target crust, simulate a click event, etc. üò® It may look something like this: 
```
import {render} from 'react-testing-library';
import {Simulate} from 'react-dom/test-utils';

describe('SearchBar', () => {
  it('updates text on Dropdown item selected', () => {
    const {queryByText, container} = render(<PizzaBuilder/>);
    
    const dropdown = container.querySelector('[aria-label="Crust picker"]');
    Simulate.mouseDown(dropdown);
    
    // You probably have something more complicated than :first-of-type
    const thinCrustItem = dropdown.querySelector('li:first-of-type');
    Simulate.mouseDown(thinCrustItem);

    expect(queryByText('Selected üçï crust: thin')).toBeTruthy();
  });
});
```
The noise-to-signal ratio is _too damn high_. All you want is to assert `Selected üçï crust: thin` exists. But you have to spend 80% of your test doing irrelevant gymnastics to trigger your item-selected handler.  
If you decided to swap out Dropdown with RadioGroup, your tests will break immediately.

If you find a component hard to unit test, it‚Äôs a strong sign that it‚Äôs too tightly-coupled.

A well-composed component should be loosely-coupled, without the need to mock or drill down its children. Let's make PizzaBuilder take CrustSelector as a prop:
```
import Dropdown from "‚Ä¶";

const PizzaBuilder = ({CrustSelector = Dropdown}) => {
  ‚Ä¶
  return <>
    <div>{status}</div>
    <CrustSelector
      onItemSelected={setCrustType}
    />
  </>;
};
```
It works exactly the same as before, except we now allow `CrustSelector` to be optionally passed in, while maintaining the simple syntax `<PizzaBuilder/>` with `Dropdown` as default.

If you decided to swap out `Dropdown` with `RadioGroup`, you can do that easily. Anyone could be a `CrustSelector` ~if you believe in yourself~, it just needs to implement `onItemSelected`.

The only link between `PizzaBuilder` and `CrustSelector` is `onItemSelected`.

Loosely-coupled components have minimal knowledge and dependencies on each other.

With [react-dispatchable](https://github.com/chuihinwai/react-dispatchable), we can now pass in a special CrustSelector that lets us trigger onItemSelected in our tests:
```
import makeDispatchable from 'react-dispatchable';
import {render} from 'react-testing-library';
import {act} from 'react-dom/test-utils';

describe('SearchBar', () => {
  it('updates text on CrustSelector item selected', () => {
    const [dispatch, TestDropdown] = makeDispatchable();  // or pass an actual Dropdown: makeDispatchable(Dropdown)
    const {queryByText} = render(<PizzaBuilder CrustSelector={TestDropdown}/>);

    act(() => dispatch.onItemSelected('thin');
    expect(queryByText('Selected üçï crust: thin')).toBeTruthy();
  });
});
```
No drilling down 50 levels deep to find the dropdown row or simulating any click events.  
Just call `onItemSelected`. That‚Äôs the beauty of loosely-coupled components.  
_Simple_. üçª

## API
`makeDispatchable(InputComponent) => [dispatch, EnhancedComponent]`  
Takes an optional input component, returns a dispatch object and an enhanced component.  
* The dispatch object will be filled with all functions passed as props after rendering, i.e.  
`dispatch.onItemSelected(1, '2', {three: 4})` is equivalent to calling  
`prop.onItemSelected(1, '2', {three: 4})` from inside the input component.
* The enhanced component should not be rendered more than once. The dispatch function only sends events to the last rendered enhanced component. [See spec](./src/dispatchable.test.js#L69)
